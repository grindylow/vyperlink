What Works So Far
=================

Create a new document ("Container Element") by going to
  http://localhost:5000/create/{{documentname}}, e.g.
  http://localhost:5000/create/DOC711

Show/Edit the document by pointing your browser at
  http://localhost:5000/show/DOC711

Insert new text elements above/below the current one with
the corresponding action icons.

Edit text with the "pencil" icon.

Save your changes with the "checkmark" icon.

Navigate from the element currently being edited to the one
above/below using the arrow keys when the caret is at the
beginning/end of the text field.


What Should Work Soon
=====================

Create implicit properties/attributes by simply specifying

  name: value

pairs inside any text elements. These properties will propagate
up to the containing element (and beyond? tbd.).

Create explicit properties by clicking the "properties" icon of
the corresponding element. (Or maybe, in-line with the KISS principle,
we will stick with only implicit properties for now.)

Then:

Refer to properties in other places.

Query the database for elements with certain properties.
